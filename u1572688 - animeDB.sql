Before Goku''s grandfather died, he gave him a Dragon Ball with four stars in it: the Four-Star Ball (Si Xing Qui). Bulma, already possessing two of the balls, decides to let Goku ''join her on a fun adventure'' so she can borrow his strength and Dragon Ball.

That man is the turtle hermit: Master Roshi, and as a reward for helping his sea turtle, he gives Goku a flying cloud called the Flying Nimbus. Master Roshi himself cannot ride the cloud, because only good and pure people can. Bulma can''t ride it either, but Goku can, because he has a good heart. Roshi also gives Bulma the Three-Star Ball (San Xing Qui), not knowing what it is. When Master Roshi returns to his island, he finds Pilaf and his two henchmen searching his house for the Dragon Ball. After he tells them that he gave it away, the three leave his island.', 3, 1),

He decides to put out the fire himself. When they arrive back at Fire Mountain, Master Roshi uses his famous Kamehame-Ha to blow out the flames. The wave puts out the fire, but it also destroys the entire mountain. With the Dragon Radar, Bulma is able to search through the rubble and find the Seven-Star Ball (Qi Xing Qui). Goku asks Master Roshi if he can learn the Kamehame-Ha, but is disappointed to find out that it took the turtle hermit 50 years to learn it. He tries it anyway, and is miraculously able to do it on the first try. ', 8, 1),

Just as they''re about to leave, two men in bunny ears begin to hassle them. Goku beats both of them up, so they call in ''the boss''. The boss, whose name is Monster Carrot arrives. He is a giant rabbit whose special power is his touch; if anyone touch him, he/she turn into a carrot. Not knowing this, Bulma slaps him, turning her into a carrot which Monster Carrot grabs. His two men then started to beat up Goku. Watching from behind a wall, Puar turns into a bird and snatches the carrot out of his hand, and Yamcha beats up the two men to save Goku.

Then he jumps down and runs off with Bulma''s suitcase, which contains their Dragon Balls. Goku tries to follow, but loses him. Luckily, Goku still has the Four-Star Ball, so Pilaf can''t make his wish to rule the world. Bulma''s Dyno-Caps were in her suitcase as well, so they have no ride. With no other options, Yamcha is forced to give them a lift. They arrive at Pilaf''s castle. Inside, they come to a dead end, but before they can turn around, a wall comes down, trapping them inside.', 10, 1),

Just when one of the balls has them cornered, it suddenly backs off, and a wall comes down again. They are trapped in the same room as before. Goku tries to use a Kamehameha wave to blast away the wall, but only manages to open up a small hole that leads outside, where Pilaf is summoning Shenron to grant his wish for world domination. Puar and Oolong turn into bats and fly through the hole to try to steal one of the balls. But before they can get close enough, Shenron himself appears. ', 11, 1),
(13, 'Goku''s Rival', 'Goku stops by his house to gather his things, then heads towards Master Roshi''s island. When he arrives, Master Roshi tells him that he will only train him if he brings him a girlfriend. Goku brings back a big ugly-looking girl but Master Roshi wanted a beautiful girl. So Goku brings a beautiful mermaid, but that doesn''t go well either. Suddenly, a small boy named Krillin paddles ashore on a boat and requests training from Master Roshi. With the help of a bribe, Master Roshi agrees to train him. He sends Goku and Krillin into the city to find him another girl. Meanwhile, Yamcha''s ship crashed, so he, Bulma, Puar, and Oolong are forced to walk through the jungle and desert.', 1, 2),
(14, 'Look Out for Launch', 'Because Krillin can''t sit on the Nimbus Cloud, he is forced to cling to Goku''s back during their search for a girl. They find a girl being attacked by two men. Goku beats up these two guys, and they bring the girl back to Master Roshi''s island. Unknown to either of them, the girl, Launch, was actually being arrested when they found her. When she sneezes, she turns into a mean, aggressive, blonde criminal. Back on the island, Roshi likes Launch so much that he agrees to take her on as a student, along with Goku and Krillin. Launch sneezes, and then takes out a machine gun and shoots at the three boys. After another sneeze, everything is back to normal. ', 2, 2),
(15, 'Find That Stone!', 'Master Roshi packs up his house in a dyno capsule, and the four of them head to a bigger island. Master Roshi tests the boys'' speed by timing them in a 100-meter dash. Krillin goes first, and runs the distance in 10.4 seconds. Goku''s time is 11 seconds, but after he takes off his old, beat-up shoes, he runs it in 8 seconds. Master Roshi dazzles them by running it in 5.6 seconds. Then he gives them their final test for the day. He makes a mark on a stone, then throws it into the woods, telling them to find it; the loser must go without dinner for the night. Krillin tries to fool Master Roshi with a stone of his own, but Roshi sees through the lie. Goku finds the stone, but Krillin steals it and runs away. Goku catches up, and the two of them fight. Goku wins, so Krillin throws a decoy stone back into the woods, and Goku runs after it, thinking it''s the real one. Krillin takes the real stone back to Master Roshi. However, Krillin ultimately loses, as Launch made pufferfish for dinner and didn''t know that it was poisonous. ', 3, 2),
(16, 'Milk Delivery', 'Master Roshi wakes the boys up early to begin their training. Their job is to deliver milk, but there are several miles between each house. After several exhausting runs, they are made to climb a mountain to deliver milk to the monk at the top. While at the top, Master Roshi tells them that in eight months, they will be competing in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament. This encouraging thought is enough to drive Goku and Krillin through the end of their milk delivery. Once the delivery ends, Master Roshi tells them that they will be delivering milk every day until the tournament. The boys are shocked to find out that the milk delivery was only their early morning training, and that they have much more to do every day. Meanwhile, Yamcha is also training for the World Martial Arts Tournament. ', 4, 2),
(17, 'The Turtle Hermit Way', 'The boys continue their workout by plowing an entire field with their bare hands. After a quick breakfast, they head over to a construction site. Here, they dig holes and haul equipment. Their speed dazzles the foreman. They eat lunch and then take a nap. Goku is getting impatient, and wants to learn fighting moves, but Master Roshi says he will not teach them fighting moves until their bodies are in the proper condition. Their next task is to swim 10 laps on a lake while they''re being chased by sharks. Then Master Roshi ties them to a tree and makes them dodge angry wasps. At the end of the day''s training, Master Roshi tells them they will be doing the same thing every day for the next eight months, but with 50 lb. turtle shells on their backs. ', 5, 2),
(18, 'The Tournament Begins', 'After several months of training, the boys are anxious to learn fighting techniques. Master Roshi tells them that he has no technique to teach them. The whole point of turtle hermit training is to get your body in superhuman condition. He says fighting is just the expression of your power. Then he gives them 100 lb. turtle shells to wear from now on. After a couple of months, the day before the tournament finally arrives. After everyone checks in; Yamcha, Bulma, Oolong, and Puar meet up with Goku. The next morning, Master Roshi gives Goku and Krillin fighting uniforms to wear. ', 6, 2),
(19, 'Elimination Round', 'The preliminary rounds are divided into four sections, with the top two from each section going on to the finals. Goku and Krillin are drawn into the same section, but are on opposite ends, so they won''t have to fight each other. Goku''s first match is against a giant, but he is able to knock him out of the ring with only a slight tap to the leg. Krillin''s first opponent is an enemy from his old martial arts school. He kicks his opponent so hard that he breaks a hole in the wall. Bulma, Oolong, and Puar are able to watch the matches through this hole. At the end of the day, Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha all advance to the quarter final round of the World Martial Arts Tournament. ', 7, 2),

When the contestants are called to the arena, Goku and Krillin leave, and Master Roshi mysteriously disappears. They draw numbers to set the quarterfinal matches. Krillin is in the first match against Bacterian, a giant whose stench is paralyzing. Yamcha is in the second match against Jackie Chun, and Goku is in the fourth match. The first match starts, and right away Krillin is paralyzed by Bacterian''s stench. Just when it looks like he''s going to lose, Goku reminds him that he doesn''t have a nose, and Krillin is able to get up and give Bacterian a taste of his own medicine. Krillin moves on to the semifinals. ', 8, 2),
(21, 'Quarterfinals Begin', 'The second match begins. Yamcha tries his best moves against Jackie Chun, but he can''t even land a punch because the old man is far too quick for him. The fight ends when Jackie Chun pushes Yamcha out of the ring with his energy. The third match between Nam and Ranfan begins. Nam is fighting for prize money to buy water for his village. Nam hits Ranfan and she starts to cry, but the crying is just an act. She takes advantage of Nam''s hesitation and quickly attacks. When Nam is able to defend her attacks easily, she takes off her clothes to distract him. Jackie Chun begins hooting wildly, and Yamcha recognizes this laughter as Master Roshi''s. He realizes that Jackie Chun is Roshi. Nam closes his eyes and is able to beat Ranfan. ', 9, 2),

Giran, Goku''s opponent, comes in and starts causing trouble. Yamcha warns Goku that Giran has been known to cheat. When the match finally starts, Giran tricks Goku into dropping his guard, then punches him. Goku responds with a furious attack and throws Giran out of the ring. Giran reveals that he can fly, and he lands safely back in bounds. He then spits rock-hard gum onto Goku, wraply trapping him. He throws Goku out of the ring, but Goku calls the flying Nimbus Cloud to save him. Just as Giran is about to punch Goku, his tail grows back and he dodges the punch.

During their date, Reiji and Mio encounter a biker who does a harmless sneak attack. Reiji goes to a church where Eren is praying. Reiji explains the situation to her, that Inferno has found them. They have a discussion where Eren reveals that during her time with Scythe master he investigated the Godo Clan to use them for his own ends, Mio''s real surname is actually Godo, which means she belongs to the Yakuza family, the Godo clan and that she was Daisuke''s half sister. They were both from different mothers and because the Godo clan is very important to Inferno and to Shiga the new leader and the one who killed Daisuke, Mio will become a vital trump card for the battle against Inferno. Eren''s intention is to be Mio''s friend so that she can use her as leverage and encourages Reiji to do the same if the Godo clan and Inferno ever catch up to them.

The operation was about Inferno helping the Godo group dispose a rival Chinese mafia from establishing a foothold in the region. As the operatives begin to take action, Scythe Master explains that Phantom can end the operation in ten seconds. Coincidentally Drei appears to crash the mafias'' meeting and kill all of them including all of Lizzie''s operatives. Lizzie disapproves of the way Scythe handled the situation. She is later told by Scythe that Cal/Drei has problems since she couldn''t end her relationship with Reiji, that in order for Drei to become the true phantom she has to kill Reiji with her own hands. Reiji, Eren and their group of friends have lunch together, but Eren is called away after receiving an unknown package. The package is a bullet sent by Drei for a meeting at the church and she departs. Reiji loses track of her and instead encounters Scythe.

Ein explains she will organize their escape route and methods of dealing with Inferno using Mio.

The call came from Reiji who was with Ein on a swing in the park identical to the one Zwei saw in the vision in the very beginning, he tells Ein that he''s happy that the innocent Cal is alive but at the same time he let her die meaning that Drei is alive with Cal existing within, Reiji understands what Cal is going through since he had been through the same predicament in the past, him existing within Zwei unable to stop himself from killing. A call from the higher ups of Inferno warns Scythe Master, Drei and Lizzie not to take any action since Mio is being held hostage by Ein and Reiji and should be secured first.

As Mio gets back home from the date, she is approached by Drei. Drei goes against Inferno and forces Mio to get on her bike at gunpoint, and is soon stopped by Lizzie. During their conversation, Drei mentions her intent to kill Mio so that the bosses can ignore her safety and allow Drei to kill Zwei.

During a short rest, Yuri divulges to Otonashi about the murder of her three younger siblings. This is Yuri''s impetus to fight against the cruel fate God gave her. Soon after meeting the Guild members, Angel is close to the main entrance; Yuri orders to abandon the Guild, and the Guild leader, Chaa, opts to raze the Guild. In the meantime, Yuri and Otonashi fight Angel to buy enough time for the Guild members to set up some explosives and to escape to the old location.

As a result, Kanade is replaced by the vice president Ayato Naoi for the council presidency. During another instance of "Operation Tornado", Kanade is surprisingly no longer hostile, ignores the commotion, and buys a meal ticket for mapo doufu.

Moments later, Naoi arrives with some NPCs and intends to punish the SSS for their constant disobedience', 5, 13),

With a shortage of meal tickets, Yuri orders a fishing expedition to catch the Monster Stream, a gigantic monster fish. Along the way, Otonashi invites Kanade, who is credited with catching Monster Stream, which produced excess fish. While serving the excess to the NPCs, Kanade and Otonashi promise to be together with the SSS.

(258, 'Dancer in the Dark', 'The SSS defend against the aggressive red-eyed Kanade, but the fight ends with the two Kanades mutually stabbing each other.

So, she orders the SSS to attend class while preventing self-obliteration, while she accesses Kanade''s computer; she adds additional abilities to reverse harmonics. In the meantime, the original Kanade is kidnapped, and the SSS learn that she is down in the abandoned Guild. Along the way, SSS members encounter more Angel clones, instead of Guild traps; again in the end, only Yuri and Otonashi remain.

When Kanade wakes him up, he becomes optimistic about his life and death, yet he remains in the afterlife. So from then onward, the two cooperate to help everyone move on from this afterlife, which was Kanade''s goal all along. In turn, they realize the true nature of this afterlife: to give souls a chance to reconcile with past regrets.

With some help, Otonashi helps her accomplish two of the three. After a couple of days, Yui gives up on the home run, but had fun with each activity. Yet, she had one special wish: marriage. Suddenly, Hinata declares that he would marry her, regardless of any handicap. Addressing the low random chance of meeting each other, Hinata describes their happy relationship, and thus Yui''s wishes are fulfilled.

The meeting is cut short when a large shadow group surrounds Noda, Shiina, and TK. Everyone at the meeting jumps into the battle, and Yuri notices an NPC-to-shadow transformation. After the battle, Fujimaki reports the loss of Takamatsu to the shadows, but he is found the next day in class as a soulless NPC. To address this shadow situation, Yuri gathers a large SSS group, and she calls out Otonashi to share his ideal about everyone passing on. Various members object, but Hinata and Naoi share his revelation. In a subsequent smaller meeting, Yuri enlists Kanade''s help before she hunts down the source of the shadows.

At the same time, he confesses his love to her, but she reveals herself as the recipient of his transplanted heart. After giving Otonashi her gratitude, she finally disappears, leaving him in frantic tears. Finally, in an epilogue, a girl resembling Kanade is humming Iwasawa''s "My Song" in the world of the living, and a boy resembling Otonashi passes by and recognizes the melody. When the girl walks onward, the boy moves to tap her shoulder.
